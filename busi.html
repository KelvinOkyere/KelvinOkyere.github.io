				<p>There is no art without communication. That is the crux of Soul Sessions: An
					experience that highlights the VERSE in converse. Here, artists embrace the space
					afforded to perform and then ford the audience’s inquisitive waters during its ensuing Q&A.
					Soul Session’s essence encapsulates both the creative and philosophical nature of what it
					means to be an artist and how they coexist together.</p>
				<p>
				<p> Busi brings forth a warm and inviting nature that encourages the artist’s ease to delve deep
					into
					what fuels them. As they share their art’s design, it informs the audience of their past
					interactions, internal inspirations and how they translate into art. The audience gains a glimpse
					into the artist’s inner sanctuary, by listening and responding with reflections of their own. Busi’s
					effervescence streamlines the give-and-take between audience and artist as she creates a space for
					deeper introspection through expression.</p>
				<p>Though most people stave off the intensity and vulnerability that comes with soulful
					symposium, Busi’s cajoling and comedic nature braves it, welcomes it and even yearns for
					it. She doesn’t adhere to the blinders of conformity and pulls this contrarian approach off
					with her goofy sincerity. She doesn’t take herself too seriously as she’s too “busi”
					regarding
					her guests sincerely. A maverick in her magnetism, she’s able to befriend any stranger and
					through Soul Sessions, she furthers her purpose to ascertain everyone’s experiences and
					enrich each other’s perspectives as a collective.</p> <br>
				The heart of Soul Sessions incarnates the conviviality of conversation and
				communication as an art. In doing so, it materializes its own artistry as a means of
				connection.
				</p>


				<p>Soul Sessions: Art meets Philosophy
					Soul Sessions is a live performance plus artist interview series, curated by
					Soulisically Speaking. Soulistically Speaking means having a deep and meaningful
					conversation. Think of it as a thread to help us navigate the path to understanding the human
					connection. Derived from the word “soul,” which in culture is often represented by the spiritual
					essence of human existence, it is about a thorough exploration of that essence. It is
					intentional
					communication, taking a deeper look at our true nature, our motives, reasoning and getting to a
					place of better understanding ourselves and each other. - Busi</p>
